# Task Oriented Desktop Assistant
A basic task oriented desktop assistant that I made for fun lol. It can open apps, websites, conducts google searches, tell the date and time etc. Few conversation openers also recognised.
App opening features supported only on windows. Some of the paths/directories used will vary for each computer.
